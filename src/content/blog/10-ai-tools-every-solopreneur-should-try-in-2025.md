For solopreneurs, chatbots can help automate customer service tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions, guiding customers through the purchasing process, and resolving common issues. By implementing a chatbot on your website or social media channels, you can provide a seamless customer experience and free up your time to focus on other aspects of your business.

## 2. AI-Powered Email Marketing Tools
